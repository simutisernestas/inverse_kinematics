# Inverse kinematics
Project task was to program the inverse kinematic algorithm for a robot, which will move its joints so that it follows a desired path with the end-effector. It is composed of two parts:
* A 3 DOF scara robot, with an inverse kinematic solution that is possible in analytic form. 
* A 7 DOF kuka robot, with the inverse kinematic solution to be implemented with iterative algorithms.

The python file kinematics_assignment_metapackage/kinematics_assignment/scripts/IK_functions.py is the file, which contains two functions, one per each robot.

Final result for both robots:
